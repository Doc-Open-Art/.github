# Doc - Open Art

### This is where I intend to publish some of my artistic creations, open source.

The main software I use is GIMP.

Typically, the projects will include:

- README file. (I always try to include a README file in each project, including the latest exports and giving some information about the project)
- 1 or more files `.xcf`
- One folder `Export` with project exports
- a possible portfolio `assets` with the material used to create the work.

*If you want to use this work in any way, please make sure you comply with the License.*

> The license depends on the project, but is generally GNU (V3)

#### Enjoy!
