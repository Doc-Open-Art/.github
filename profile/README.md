# GIMP - Open Art

### Share your GIMP knowledge, as open-source artworks projects.

Sharing knowledge is great!  

You can learn new techniques from other people's work and show and explain how you did your artworks.  

So, i decided to create this organization and start sharing GIMP project repository.

> The artworks in this repositories are original and provided under GNU v3 Licence.


### Classic repository

Typically, the projects will include:

- 1 or more `.xcf` files (GIMP project file)
- `export` folder with project exports
- `assets` folder with the material used to create the work (if needed)
- README file. 

> Always try to include a README file in each project, including the latest exports and some information about the project.
> Explanation of how you did it in the README is welcome!
