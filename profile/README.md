# Doc - Open Art

### I intend to publish some of my artistic creations here, as open source.

> The main software I use is GIMP.

Typically, the projects will include:

- README file. (I always try to include a README file in each project, including the latest exports and giving some information about the project)
- 1 or more `.xcf` files (GIMP project file)
- One folder `export` with project exports
- A possible `assets` folder with the material used to create the work.

*If you want to use this work in any way, please make sure you comply with the License.*

> The license depends on the project, but is generally GNU (V3) :)

*This is a [@doc-code-hub](https://github.com/doc-code-hub) initiative*
# Enjoy!
